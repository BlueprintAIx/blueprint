# Introduction 
At our core, we're simplifying Web3 interactions through intelligent agents and infrastructure. To start, we're showing you exactly how you can leverage Blueprint to build a powerful agent, take it to market, and turn it into a protocol of its own. Soon, we'll put the the tools in your hand to build anything on-chain.

We’re entering a new era of intelligent systems — one where AI Agents don’t just answer questions, they act. At Blueprint, we’re building the infrastructure for this agentic future — starting on-chain, expanding beyond it, and ultimately redefining how people and systems interact.
